## Kaggle
This project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). My Logistic Regression model scored a 66% on the first try. After re-training the model a few times, I improved my score to 75%. I beleive I can bring the model's score even higher while I continue to learn more machine learning algorithms. I will update this repository if I improve my score again.
